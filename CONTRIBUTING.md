## Code Guidelines

StreamMe's OpenSourceBot uses [happiness code style][1] in all of its files. Make sure to check
all of your changes to the code by running `happiness` in your command prompt before you commit. 
Tabs are 2 spaces, and each line ends with a semicolon.

Try to maintain similar whitespace and other formatting styles to the rest of the code.

## Committing Changes

All changes made to this code should be pushed to a remote feature branch, preferably with a name 
summarizing the change made (ex: 'Adding new command'). Then open a pull request to master, setting
user `BeauRussell` as a reviewer.

CI will make sure the code is up to `happiness` standards, and if so, you will be able to merge the
pull request once the owner has given approval.
